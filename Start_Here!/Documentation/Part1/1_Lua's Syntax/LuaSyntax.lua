_________ PARTS OF A FUNCTION _________

   { 
  	 1: Function  	
   	 2: Func Name    
  	 3: Paramaters (Inside the () there can be paramaters, or predefined variables),
   	 4: end,
   }

	There is 1 Function type, however you can write it 3 ways
--]]

-- [1]: a Global "Function" (Can be called from anywhere below it in the script) Ex:


function myGlobalFunction(isThisAFunction)  -- Can be empty
	-- Code here
	print(isThisAFunction) -- returns true
	
end

myGlobalFunction(true) -- This fires the function, can be written anywhere below the function.


-- [2]: a Local "Function" (Can be called from anywhere below it, if it's in the same function) Ex:

function holderFunction() 

	local function myLocalFunction()
		
	end
	
	myLocalFunction()
end
-- myLocalFunction CANNOT BE CALLED outside of the function it originates in.
holderFunction() -- This function is global
--[[

  [3]: Connect "Function" (It requires a event to be connected to it.)

	Parts of Connect "Function": 
	{
	  1: Variable (Must be somesort of an Instance, or Service)
	  2: Event, a event is modeled by the âš¡ emoji on the drop down menu.
	  3: :Connect()
	  4: Function + Params (This function cannot be named)
	}

--]]
-- Ex:

--  Variable  | Event  | Connect | Function
game.Workspace.Changed:Connect(function()  -- Runs whenever the event is triggered
	-- Code here
end) --- MAKE SURE for every open ( you add closed ), same with [], {}, "", '', ``


--[[ 
If you want to call the function you must make it a variable,
however, there isn't a need to do this unless you need to call the function-
another time.

_________ Global Variables _________

Global variables, can be accessed between scripts 

 Parts of a global var:
 1: _G
 2: .
 3: Variable name
 
 Global variables are differnt for the server and client,
 so if I made a global variable in a ServerScript, only the server can access it.
 If I made it in a LocalScript, only the Client can access it.
--]]

_G.ServerAge = 100

--[In another Server Script you can do]--

print(_G.ServerAge)

--]]

local min = 1
local max = 100

math.random(min,max) -- Returns a whole value, between the two numbers.
huge =math.huge -- returns the max Integer value 
math.min(205,50,20,205,21,28459,39,1) --- Returns the lowest int value, without it having to be ordered.
math.max(205,50,20,205,21,28459,39,1) --- Returns the highest int value, without it having to be ordered.
math.rad(max) --- Returns the angle
math.round(10.03000301) --- Rounds to nearest whole value
pi = math.pi --- Returns pie ðŸ¥Ÿ (not that, this: Ï€)


Vector3.new(0,0,0) -- (X , Y , Z) for a Position or Size or just a vector 3
Vector2.new(0,0) -- (X,Y) Horizontal and Vertical
CFrame.new(Vector3.new(0,0,0),Vector3.new(0,0,0)) -- (X , Y , Z)^2, a Cordinate Frame, has a Position (Vector 3) and Orienation (Vector 3)
---			Position         ,    Orientation
